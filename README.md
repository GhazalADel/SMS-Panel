### SMS Sending with Templates

The SMS Panel Project allows you to send SMS messages with customizable templates that can be dynamically populated with variables. This feature enables you to personalize the messages by inserting specific values such as names, dates, prefixes, and usernames into the content of the SMS.

To use this feature, you can include special placeholder variables in your SMS message templates. When sending the SMS, these variables will be substituted with the corresponding values based on the context. Here are the supported variables and their usage:

- `%name`: Replaced with the name of the phone book number.
- `%date`: Replaced with the current date and time.
- `%prefix`: Replaced with the prefix of the phone book number object.
- `%username`: Replaced with the username of the phone book number.

Here's an example of how you can use these variables in your SMS message template:

```plaintext
Hello %name! This is a reminder for your appointment on %date. Please arrive on time. Your prefix is %prefix. Thank you, %username.
```

In the above example, when sending an SMS using this template, the `%name` variable will be replaced with the actual name of the phone book number, `%date` will be replaced with the current date and time, `%prefix` will be replaced with the prefix of the phone book number, and `%username` will be replaced with the username of the phone book number.
